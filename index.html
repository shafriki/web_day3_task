        <h1>Git and GitHub</h1>
        <p>Git is a powerful distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to manage the development of the Linux kernel. It enables multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes. Git tracks changes to files and allows for robust version control, featuring branching and merging capabilities that support non-linear workflows. Developers can create branches to work on new features or bug fixes independently and merge them back into the main codebase when ready. Additionally, Gitâ€™s distributed nature means every developer has a complete copy of the repository, including its entire history, ensuring data integrity and facilitating collaboration even without a central server.

            GitHub, launched in 2008 and acquired by Microsoft in 2018, is a web-based platform that leverages Git for version control and provides a comprehensive collaborative environment for software development. GitHub hosts repositories where code and project files are stored and can be either public or private. It introduces pull requests, which are essential for code reviews and discussions before integrating changes into the main codebase. GitHub also offers robust project management tools, including issues for tracking bugs and feature requests, and project boards for organizing and prioritizing work. Moreover, GitHub Actions automate workflows, enabling continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) directly within the platform. Together, Git and GitHub form a cornerstone of modern software development, enhancing collaboration, version control, and project management.</p><button id="btn">Read More</button>
